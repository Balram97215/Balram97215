## 👨‍💻 About Me: The "Shadow IT" Engineer

I am an **Analytics Engineer** who started my career in **Operations & Business Development**. 

Early in my career at fast-paced startups, I realized that manual Excel processes were the bottleneck to growth. Instead of accepting the status quo, I taught myself **Python and SQL** to build the automation infrastructure those companies lacked. 

I don't just analyze data; I build the *systems* that make data reliable. My background allows me to translate complex business requirements (Supply Chain, Finance, Compliance) into robust technical solutions.

* **Core Focus:** Data Governance, ETL Automation, Supply Chain Network Optimization.
* **Signature Move:** Transforming "Toxic Data Swamps" into "Single Sources of Truth."

## 💼 Professional Experience (Case Studies)

*Detailed breakdowns of the technical infrastructure I built in professional environments.*

### 🔹 [NICE Actimize | Automated Data Validation Framework](https://github.com/Balram97215/SQL-Migration-Case-Study)
**Role:** SQL DEVELOPER (PROFESSIONAL SERVICES)
* **The Problem:** Manual data validation for AML compliance was causing massive onboarding delays.
* **The Fix:** Engineered database-agnostic SQL queries to automate NULL scans and type checks.
* **The Result:** Reduced manual QA effort by **80%** and presented efficiency gains to C-Suite leadership.
* *Note: Linked repo demonstrates SQL Migration & Validation techniques used in this role.*

### 🔹 [Indian Vellness Solutions (IVS) | Supply Chain Network Optimization](https://github.com/Balram97215/IVS-OLHS-Integration)
**Role:** SENIOR BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT (DATA OPERATIONS & ANALYTICS)
* **The Problem:** Post-acquisition chaos. No data infrastructure to decide where to place a West Coast warehouse.
* **The Fix:** Built a **"Shadow IT" Python pipeline** to consolidate vendor logs and co-developed a **Geospatial Network Optimizer** (Center of Gravity logic).
* **The Result:** Identified a warehouse zone projected to reduce shipping costs by **15-20%** and established a Single Source of Truth.

### 🔹 [Transview Enterprise (TVI) | Operations Analytics & Six Sigma](https://github.com/Balram97215/TVI-Product_Development-Supply_Chain_Analytics)
**Role:** EXECUTIVE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT (SUPPLY CHAIN ANALYTICS)
* **The Problem:** "Pack-to-Load" times hit 3 days due to inefficient warehouse slotting.
* **The Fix:** Spearheaded a **Lean Six Sigma** initiative using ABC Analysis to re-slot high-velocity SKUs and implemented **A/B Testing** for product bundles.
* **The Result:** Eliminated the 3-day backlog, returning to a 24-hour SLA, and reduced picker travel distance by 30%.
