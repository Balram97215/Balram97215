## 👨‍💻 My Journey: The "Unconventional" Engineer

As a **first generation** undergrad and masters graduate, the traditional playbooks wasn't an option for me. I learned early on that if you want a path, you often have to pave it yourself.

My journey began far away from Silicon Valley, deep in the trenches of **Operations**, where "data" wasn't a clean SQL table it was a stack of mess and urgent deadlines.

**The "Why":**
In those early days, I watched smart people make tough decisions without the right insights. I realized that **waste** wasn't happening because people were lazy; it was happening because their approach to data was misaligned with the industry's rapid growth.

**The Pivot:**
The chaotic startup environment was a blessing in disguise. With no boundaries to stop me, I learned to take initiative. I taught myself the skills needed to solve problems on the fly, collaborating with SMEs to execute solutions. This journey taught me a critical lesson:

> **"Technology without context is just an algorithm. But technology *with* context is a superpower."**

**The Transition:**
Eventually, I pursued my **M.S. in Business Analytics** at the Isenberg School of Management (UMass Amherst). At that point, my path was still blurry. I had the drive, but I lacked the granular clarity of where I fit. It was my internship at **NICE Actimize** in 2024 that finally clicked: I loved writing queries. I loved understanding the infrastructure. I loved using data to answer business questions.

**Where I Am Now:**
Today, I am cementing that transition. I am actively pursuing **Professional Data Engineering certifications** to combine my operational grit with enterprise grade technical standards.

My goal is to formalize my experience into a career as a **Data Engineer** building the infrastructure that allows SMEs to stop guessing and start leading.

**My Mission:**
To orchestrate data not just to improve profits today, but to build a more **efficient, sustainable foundation for the next generation.**
