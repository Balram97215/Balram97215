> *Transforming fragmented data into strategic assets through Governance, Engineering, and Analytics.*

I am a **Data Analyst** with a specialized focus on **Data Governance** and **Quality Assurance**. With a background spanning Operations, Supply Chain, and Finance, I don't just analyze data; I build the *systems* that make data reliable. I have a proven track record of reducing manual QA efforts by **85%** and cutting onboarding times by **40%** through rigorous stewardship.

Currently completing my **MS in Business Analytics** at the Isenberg School of Management (UMass Amherst).

## 🧠 How I Work: The Governance Mindset
*My approach to projects is grounded in structure, visibility, and risk mitigation.*

* **Agile Velocity & Planning:** I treat data projects like software products. I utilize **Sprint Planning** and **Velocity Tracking** to ensure deliverables—from data ingestion to dashboarding—hit strategic milestones on time.
* **Proactive Risk Management:** I don't wait for pipelines to break. I maintain active **Risk & Issue Registers** to identify bottlenecks (e.g., API limits, privacy compliance) early, implementing mitigation strategies before they impact the business.
* **Clear Accountability (RACI):** Success requires clarity. I define precise **RACI Matrices** to ensure cross-functional teams (Engineers, Analysts, Stakeholders) understand their ownership in the data lifecycle.
