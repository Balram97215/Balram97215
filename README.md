## 👨‍💻 About Me: The "Unconventional" Engineer

If you told me five years ago that I’d be losing sleep over SQL query optimization, I probably would have asked:

> *"When did you start writing a sequel for a movie plot?"* >
> **LOL! SERIOUSLY, right?**

I was not a typical techie—not even close. As a **First-Generation undergraduate and master’s graduate**, I didn’t have a playbook to succeed in a professional career. I didn't start in a computer lab; I started on the operational frontlines of **Manufacturing and Supply Chain**.

**The "Why"**
In those early days, I spent a lot of time watching smart people make tough decisions simply because they couldn't see the numbers. I saw warehouses overstocked with the wrong inventory and trucks shipping empty air. It drove me crazy. I realized that **waste** wasn't happening because people were lazy; it was happening because the **data was a mess**.

**The Pivot**
The chaotic startup environment was a blessing in disguise. With no boundaries to stop me, I learned to take initiative. I taught myself the skills needed to solve problems on the fly, collaborating with SMEs to execute solutions. This journey taught me a critical lesson:

> **"Technology without context is just an algorithm. But technology *with* context is a superpower."**

**The Transition**
Eventually, I pursued my **M.S. in Business Analytics** at the Isenberg School of Management (UMass Amherst). At that point, my path was still blurry—I had the drive, but I lacked the granular clarity of where I fit. It was my internship at **NICE Actimize** in 2024 that finally clicked: I loved writing queries. I loved understanding the infrastructure. I loved using data to answer business questions.

**Where I Am Now**
Today, I am cementing that transition. I am actively pursuing **Professional Data Engineering certifications** to combine my operational grit with enterprise-grade technical standards.

My goal is to formalize my experience into a career as a **Data Engineer**—building the infrastructure that allows SMEs to stop guessing and start leading.

**My Mission**
To orchestrate data not just to improve profits today, but to build a more **efficient, sustainable foundation for the next generation.**
