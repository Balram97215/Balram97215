## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am an **Analytics Engineer** who started my career in **Operations & Business Development**.

Early in my career at fast-paced startups, I realized that manual Excel processes were the bottleneck to growth. Instead of accepting the status quo, I taught myself **Python and SQL** to build the automation infrastructure those companies lacked.

I don't just analyze data; I build the *systems* that make data reliable. My background allows me to translate complex business requirements (Supply Chain, Finance, Compliance) into robust technical solutions.

* **Core Focus:** Data Governance, ETL Automation, Supply Chain Network Optimization.
* **Signature Move:** Transforming "Toxic Data Swamps" into "Single Sources of Truth."
