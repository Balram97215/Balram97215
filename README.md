## 👨‍💻 About Me

**I didn't inherit a roadmap for my career. As a First-Generation Undergraduate and Master’s graduate, I had to pave my own.**

I didn’t start in a server room or a computer lab. I started on the operational frontlines of manufacturing and supply chain. At the time, I didn't have the vocabulary for what I was seeing, but I had a gut feeling: Information is gold, yet most businesses treat it like exhaust.

**The Pattern**, In those early years, I saw the same story repeat itself. I saw brilliant teams held back because their insights were trapped in fragmented spreadsheets. I saw "gut feelings" masking as strategy. I saw wasted time, wasted resources, and wasted potential, all because the decision makers couldn't see the full picture.

I realized that the biggest bottleneck wasn't a lack of effort; it was a lack of orchestration.

**The Turning Point**, I couldn't wait for a dedicated IT team to fix these problems, so I decided to fix them myself. I stumbled upon tools that, to the tech world, were standard, but to me, were revelations. I began stitching together disparate data sources. I automated the boring stuff. I turned chaos into clarity.

What started as "survival" in a chaotic startup environment slowly turned into a fascination. I realized that I didn't just want to use the systems; I wanted to build them. I fell in love with the nuance of taking dispersed, messy information and architecting it into a Single Source of Truth.

**The Realization**, This journey taught me that technology without context is just code. But technology with context is a superpower.

**Today**, I am cementing that transition. I am actively pursuing Professional Data Engineering certifications to combine my operational grit with enterprise grade technical standards. My goal is to formalize my experience into a career as a Data Engineer building the infrastructure that allows SMEs to stop guessing and start leading.

**My Mission** To orchestrate data not just to improve profits today, but to build a more efficient, sustainable foundation for the next generation.
